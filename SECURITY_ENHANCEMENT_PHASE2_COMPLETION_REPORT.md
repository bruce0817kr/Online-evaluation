## üîß Security Architecture

### Security Middleware Stack
```python
# Layered Security Approach:
1. EnhancedSecurityMiddleware (Comprehensive monitoring)
2. SecurityMiddleware (Rate limiting, headers)  
3. RequestValidationMiddleware (Input validation)
4. FileUploadSecurityMiddleware (File security)
5. IPWhitelistMiddleware (Access control)
```

### Monitoring & Alerting
```python
# Real-time Security Monitoring:
- Redis-based event streaming
- MongoDB persistent storage with indexes
- Automated threat intelligence updates
- Real-time alerts for critical events
- Security metrics dashboard
```

### API Security Endpoints
```python
# Security Management APIs:
GET /api/security/health          # Security system health check
GET /api/security/metrics         # Security metrics (Admin only)
GET /api/security/threat-intelligence  # Threat reports (Admin only)
```
